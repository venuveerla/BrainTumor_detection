# BrainTumor_detection
###  Overview
This project implements a brain tumor detection system using Python with machine learning models, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression. The system is designed to classify MRI images into tumor or non-tumor categories with high accuracy.
### Accuracy Scores
1. Logistic Regression: 84.1%
2. SVM: 86.25%
### Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the models consists of MRI images having 4 classes each of 800-900 images. The images are preprocessed and resized to 200x200 pixels in grayscale.
### Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the project:
1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV
3. scikit-learn
4. NumPy
### Conclusion
The SVM model outperforms the Logistic Regression model in this brain tumor detection task. Future work can include exploring other machine learning models, deep learning approaches, and expanding the dataset for improved accuracy and generalization.
